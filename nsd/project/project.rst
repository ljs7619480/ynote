Practical Project
=================

To get the most from the :doc:`technical materials <../index>`, it is important
for readers to practice the techniques in building real software of a
scientific, mathematic, or numerical application.  The project may be assessed
based on the following guidelines: :ref:`good engineering infrastructure
<nsd-grading-soft>`, :ref:`correct implementation and solution to the problem
<nsd-grading-correct>`, :ref:`adequate architecture <nsd-grading-arch>`, and
:ref:`clear presentation <nsd-grading-present>`.
