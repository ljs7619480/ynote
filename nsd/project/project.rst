=================
Practical Project
=================

Readers are expected to build an open-software package of a scientific,
mathematic, or numerical application to practice the techniques in the
:doc:`technical materials <../index>`.  The practical project is a critical
companion of the :doc:`technical materials <../index>`, and should include also
a proposal of the code development and a presentation.

The software package, of which the source code is publicly available, needs to
be hosted on `github.com <https://github.com/>`__. The software needs to be
executable on the `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS <http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`__ on
64-bit x86 through command line. Building the software package should use a
single command.

Assessment
==========

The project may be assessed based on the following sets of guideline:
:ref:`good engineering infrastructure <nsd-grading-soft>`, :ref:`correct
implementation and solution to the problem <nsd-grading-correct>`,
:ref:`adequate architecture <nsd-grading-arch>`, and :ref:`clear presentation
<nsd-grading-present>`.
