Numerical Software Development
==============================

This is a note for using Python and C++ to develop high-performance and highly
flexible numerical software systems.  It has two parts.  The :ref:`first
<nsd-first-part>` is the recapitulation of how computers work.  The
:ref:`second <nsd-second-part>` is the practical implementation skill.
