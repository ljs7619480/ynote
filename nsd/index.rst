Numerical Software Development
==============================

`Numerical software development <https://yungyuc.github.io/nsd>`__ is a course
taught in NCTU, dept of CS, focusing on the art to build numerical software,
i.e., computer programs applying numerical methods for solving mathematical or
physical problems.

It introduces the hybrid architecture popular in the industry and shows how to
use Python and C++ for implementation.  I expect students to practice serious
software engineering and obtain fundamental skills for developing modern
numerical software systems.

The contents have two parts.  First, the recapitulation of how computers work:

1. Engineering practices
2. Python and numpy
3. C++ and computer architecture
4. Matrix operations
5. Cache optimization
6. Vector processing

Second, the practical implementation skills:

7. Memory management
8. Ownership and smart pointers
9. Modern C++
10. C++ and C for Python
11. Array code in C++
12. Advanced Python
